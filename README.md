- 👋 Hi, I’m @shashank
- 👀 I’m interested in  in comparative genomics of bacteria with a specific focus on exploring the gut microbiome on healthy and diseased individuals. My expertise spans across analyzing genomic, transcriptomic and also exploring the microbial diversity through the metagenomic sequencing and analysis of various environments such as soil and human gut. I am also interested in looking at the effect of host genetics on the gut microbiome, understand the role of metabolites in human health, and integrative genomic data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning correlations between host and microbial network modules and to traits
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on host-microbes interaction
